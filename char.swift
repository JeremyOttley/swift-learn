// Creating a character
var letter: Character = "H"    // Must use Character keyword
var symbol: Character = "@"    // Can be any single symbol
var space: Character = " "     // Even spaces are characters

// Important: Single quotes don't work in Swift
// let wrong: Character = 'H'  // This will cause a compiler error

// Characters vs Strings
let singleChar: Character = "A"    // Single character
let multipleChars: String = "ABC"  // String (multiple characters)
